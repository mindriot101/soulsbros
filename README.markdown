# Dark souls bros

A meeting place for Dark Souls collaboration/antagonism. Mostly it should be a way to easily update your character's details as this may quickly become desynchronised.

## Design

The design works in two ways: one for helpers and one for helpees. The helpers create posts offering help, and the helpees can view the posts sorted by most useful.

Both use cases require the user to input their character details, which is kept in a box on the home page.

Each user can post their character and location to a region-localised board. Each post corresponds of

* username
* soul level
* location
* build

After assisting/invading the user can be rated and classed as an invader or sunbro for other users to see.

### Phantoms

### Helpees

Can rate the other players and classify them based on whether they invaded or helped.
